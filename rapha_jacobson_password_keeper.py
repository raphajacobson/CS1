Description: Asks user to input passwords and the program stores them. The program can delete passwords, changes, passwords, access passwords, generate passwords, export passwords to a spreadsheet, and check the security of passwords.

Challenges:
1.Allow the user to retroactively add more usernames and passwords
2. Allow the user to change usernames and passwords
3. Store the list of websites with usernames and passwords in an excel spreadsheet
4. Require a password to enter the password keeper
5. Generate a secure password for the user
6. heck how complex/secure the passwords are
7. Delete a password
